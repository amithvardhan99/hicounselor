    "**Problem Statement:**\n",
    "This project addresses the pressing issue of diabetes prevalence in the United States, aiming to predict distinct risk categories using the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2015 dataset. The dataset, comprising 50,000 survey responses, poses a challenge due to class imbalance. The objective is to develop a predictive model that effectively classifies individuals into three categories: 0 for no diabetes/only during pregnancy, 1 for prediabetes, and 2 for diabetes. The emphasis is on mitigating class imbalance to enhance the accuracy of the predictive modeling process.\n",
    "\n",
    "**About the Dataset:**\n",
    "The dataset used in this project is sourced from the CDC's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2015, obtained from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository. It comprises 21 feature variables and a target variable (Diabetes_012) categorizing respondents into stages: 0 for no diabetes/only during pregnancy, 1 for prediabetes, and 2 for diabetes."

Mixed data : Cleveland Heart Disease Data
Description
The Cleveland Heart Disease Data found in the UCI machine learning repository consists of 14 variables measured on 303 individuals who have heart disease. The individuals had been grouped into five levels of heart disease. The information about the disease status is in the HeartDisease.target data set.
Format
Three data frames with 303 observations on the following 14 variables.
age
age in years
sex
sex (1 = male; 0 = female)
cp
chest pain type. 1: typical angina, 2: atypical angina, 3: non-anginal pain, 4: asymptomatic

trestbps
resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)

chol
serum cholestoral in mg/dl

fbs
(fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false)

restecg
resting electrocardiographic results. 0: normal, 1: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST, elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV) 2: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes\' criteria

thalach
maximum heart rate achieved

exang
exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)

oldpeak
ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest

slope
the slope of the peak exercise ST segment 1: upsloping, 2: flat, 3: downsloping

ca
number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy (4 missing values)

thal
3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect (2 missing values)

num
diagnosis of heart disease (angiographic disease status). 0: < 50 1: > 50 (in any major vessel: attributes 59 through 68 are vessels)

Details
The variables consist of five continuous and eight discrete attributes, the former in the HeartDisease.cont data set and the later in the HeartDisease.cat data set. Three of the discrete attributes have two levels, three have three levels and two have four levels. There are six missing values in the data set.
